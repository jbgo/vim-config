# vim-config

My vim configurations on top of the
[carlhuda/janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) vim distribution.
This repo is intended to be used along side a default installation of
janus, so you need to have that installed first before installing
this one.

## Installation

    cd ~
    git clone git://github.com/jbgo/vim-config.git ~/.vim-config
    ./.vim-config/install.sh

## Updates

    cd ~/.vim-config
    git pull

You can (and should) update vim-config and janus independently of one
another.
